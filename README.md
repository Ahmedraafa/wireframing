# Wireframing

## What is Wireframing?
Wireframing is the process of creating a basic visual guide to structure the layout and functionality of a webpage or application. It acts as a blueprint, helping designers and developers collaborate effectively during the design process.

## Importance of Wireframing
Wireframing is crucial because it helps:
- Visualize the overall structure of the design.
- Address usability challenges early.
- Facilitate communication among stakeholders.
- Provide a foundation for creating high-fidelity designs and prototypes.

## Key Elements of Wireframing

1. **Layout Structure**  
   Defines the arrangement of elements to ensure a logical flow.  
   *Example*: Positioning the header, sidebar, and footer.

2. **Navigation**  
   Establishes how users move through the application.  
   *Example*: Adding menus, links, and breadcrumbs.

3. **Content Placement**  
   Determines where key content resides.  
   *Example*: Highlighting CTAs (Call to Actions) or placing banners.

4. **Functionality**  
   Ensures interactive elements are represented.  
   *Example*: Including placeholders for forms or buttons.

## Types of Wireframes

### Low-Fidelity Wireframes
These are basic sketches used to map out the structure and flow.  
*Example Use Case*: Early-stage brainstorming sessions.

### High-Fidelity Wireframes
These include detailed elements like colors, fonts, and interactivity.  
*Example Use Case*: Later stages to finalize design details.

### Identifying Wireframe Types
Low-fidelity wireframes prioritize simplicity, while high-fidelity wireframes provide a near-complete visual representation.
